## Spectral Sine-Series Poisson Solver

**Status (2026-07-23): production-ready.** `SpectralPoissonSolver` is implemented,
registered, validated, and optimized on both CPU and CUDA; the full test suite is
green (including the new spectral accuracy and CPU/CUDA consistency tests). It is a
documented (commented) option in `examples/strong_strong_tracking.jl`. Recommended
production setting for the ~11:1 flat beams: `grid=(128, 1024)`, `domain_factor=16`,
`method=:grid`. Headline numbers: kick matches the analytic soft-Gaussian solver to
~0.2% (round) / ~0.4% (production flat); CPU 2.0 s/turn (100k/beam, 15 slices, 8
threads); CUDA 0.62 s/turn at 2.56M/beam, ~4x faster than PIC on GPU.

References: method + measured accuracy in `docs/spectral_sine_poisson_solver.md`;
performance + validation history in
`validation/strong_strong_spectral_optimization_history.md`; reference field
implementations in `validation/spectral_poisson_field_validation.jl`. Code:
`src/tasks/strongstrong/spectral.jl` (CPU) and `spectral_cuda.jl` (CUDA).

The only substantive remaining work is the longitudinal synchro-beam kick (v1 is
transverse-only); everything else Open is optional.

### Open

- Longitudinal synchro-beam kick: v1 is transverse-only (reads original positions,
  accumulates px/py). Add the drift-to-collision-point and pz kick so the spectral
  solver covers the full 6D map like the Gaussian/PIC paths. (This also constrains
  the field-slice CPU parallelization, which currently relies on order-independent
  transverse accumulation.)
- Density-overlap luminosity refinement: the current integral agrees with PIC to
  ~4%; drift the source slices to the collision midpoint (as PIC does) to close the
  residual if exact agreement is wanted.
- Optional CUDA throughput: batch the many small per-slice-pair FFTs across pairs
  (currently sequential). Not pursued yet — the grid path is already ~4x faster
  than PIC on GPU, so this is past the point of clear benefit; revisit if a much
  larger slice count makes launch overhead dominate.
- Optional precision refinement: TSC field interpolation (or a finer mesh) to
  close the round-beam gap between the interpolated on-mesh result (~2.7e-3) and
  the per-point analytic (~1.6e-3).
- Optional: circular (Fourier-Bessel) domain variant for round beams, per
  `docs/spectral_sine_poisson_solver.md` Section 12.

### Completed

- Density-overlap luminosity (CPU and CUDA): CIC-deposit both source slices on a
  shared grid, sum the product, scale `npart1*npart2/(nmacro1*nmacro2)` over the
  cell area. Matches `_pic_luminosity!` to machine precision on identical inputs and
  agrees with PIC/Gaussian to ~4% on the production beams.
- CPU caching + parallelism: reusable per-worker workspace pool (deposit/mode/
  derivative buffers + FFTW plans, mode-Green recomputed only when the box changes),
  cutting per-solve allocation ~18 MiB -> 105 KiB; collision parallelized over field
  slices. 100k/beam, 15 slices, grid 128x1024: 9.7 -> 2.0 s/turn (~4.1x on 8
  threads), bit-consistent across thread counts.
- CUDA `collide!` for the grid path (`spectral_cuda.jl`): DST-I/DCT-I built from
  complex cuFFT of symmetric extensions (verified to machine precision vs FFTW),
  one in-place plan per dimension, cached workspace, custom deposit/interp-scatter/
  luminosity kernels. Agrees with the CPU path to ~4e-16 (kicks) and ~9e-16
  (luminosity); 0.62 s/turn at 2.56M/beam, ~4x faster than PIC CUDA at matched grid.
- Validation tests in `test/runtests.jl`: spectral-vs-Gaussian accuracy (both
  variants, round beam, <3%) and CPU/CUDA consistency (rtol 1e-9).
- Production parameter selection: grid `(128, 1024)`, `domain_factor=16` for ~11:1
  beams (grid-converged kick to ~1%, at the graininess floor). See the dated
  `validation/strong_strong_spectral_optimization_history.md`.

### Completed (solver core)

- `SpectralPoissonSolver{T} <: AbstractPoissonSolver`
  (`src/tasks/strongstrong/spectral.jl`): auto-registered, structured option
  schema (`slicing`/`slicing1`/`slicing2`, physical `kbb1`/`kbb2`,
  `luminosity_scale`, `grid`, `domain_factor`, `method`), both `:grid` (CIC deposit
  -> 2D DST -> mode solve -> on-mesh DST/DCT derivative -> interpolate) and
  `:grid_free` (direct converged mode sums) field solves, and a transverse CPU
  `collide!` over slice pairs in collision order.
- Field-solve normalization pinned to physical units. The source deposit is
  normalized to unit charge inside the field solve, so the field is the
  per-unit-charge Bassetti-Erskine field and the caller applies physical
  `kbb * slice_weight` **identically to `GaussianPoissonSolver`** (no `/n_macro`;
  kbb means the same across Gaussian/PIC/spectral). Two separately pinned scale
  constants: grid folds in the DST inverse-normalization and grows with mode count;
  grid-free uses a mode-count-independent constant (the direct sum is converged).
  Verified: round-beam kick matches the soft-Gaussian solver to ~0.2% for both
  variants, and stays within ~0.3% across `domain_factor` 10-16 (drift at larger
  `d` is fixed-grid resolution loss, not normalization).
- Flat-beam box fix. `_spectral_box` was sizing the Dirichlet box anisotropically
  (`Ly ~ d*sigma_y`), which clips the wide field of a flat beam (its transverse
  field extends on the `sigma_large` scale in both directions) and biased the
  wide-direction kick by ~9% at 5:1 (plateauing, not a resolution effect). Fixed
  to a square box sized to `sigma_max` in both directions, matching the docs and
  the earlier validation, with the thin direction resolved by the grid (`Ny`).
  Verified against the soft-Gaussian solver: flat 5:1 now matches to ~0.5% at
  `(128,512)`, and the production ~11:1 flat beam matches to ~0.4% at `(128,1024)`
  (`N_thin ~ 5*d*sigma_x/sigma_y`); round-beam accuracy is unchanged.
- Derivation of the 2D Fourier sine-series Poisson solver, discrete DST/FFT form,
  open-boundary discussion, circular/elliptical generalization, and correctness
  checks (manufactured band-limited solution recovered to 1e-15).
- Accuracy validation against Bassetti-Erskine for round and flat beams, with
  domain-size and thin-direction scaling regressions and parameter-selection
  guidance (domain `d ~ 12-16*max(sigma)`; anisotropic grid).
- Grid and grid-free variants with a computational-complexity comparison
  (grid/DST is 100-1000x faster than grid-free).
- Exact spectral field derivative: 2-3x more accurate than finite differences;
  the solver beats PIC on flat beams (25:1 median ~30% lower, max ~3x better) and
  ties on round.
- Fast on-mesh spectral-derivative field pipeline (O(Nx*Ny*log)) validated to
  retain the accuracy advantage at ~4x lower cost than PIC. The DST-I mesh cosine
  derivative equals a zero-padded DCT-I (verified to machine precision).

## Earlier Completed

- Soft-Gaussian CUDA optimization (host-sync removal, device moments, fused
  wavefront launches): 0.2778 -> 0.2280 s/turn, bit-identical. See
  `validation/strong_strong_gaussian_optimization_history.md`.
- PIC `kbb1/kbb2` override switched to physical units, consistent across all
  solvers and frozen-beam elements.
- Strong-strong example and task notebook default to the PIC solver with the
  soft-Gaussian solver as a commented alternative.
- Lorentz crossing maps classified as Hirata quasi-symplectic (`NonSymplectic6DMap`).
