## Spectral Sine-Series Poisson Solver

**Status (2026-07-23): production-ready transverse solver; full 6D map
implemented, correctness-validated against PIC, and under performance
characterization.** `SpectralPoissonSolver` is implemented, registered,
validated, and optimized on both CPU and CUDA. It is a documented (commented)
option in `examples/strong_strong_tracking.jl`. Recommended production setting for
the ~11:1 flat beams: `grid=(128, 1024)`, `domain_factor=16`, `method=:grid`.

**Correctness note (2026-07-23):** the grid-path longitudinal `pz` kick was found
~2x too large (the on-mesh potential reconstruction carried a factor 2 relative to
the field because both shared one fitted `scale`); fixed with an explicit `1/2` in
`Phig` on CPU and CUDA. The grid `pz` kick now matches PIC to ~0.5% and grid-free
to ~1%. See the optimization history for the derivation and regression guards. In the grid solver this means both a `128x1024` interior mesh and
a `128x1024` sine-mode expansion; in `method=:grid_free`, the same option is a
direct mode-count tuple and no mesh is used. Transverse-kick headline numbers: kick matches the analytic
soft-Gaussian solver to ~0.2% (round) / ~0.4% (production flat); transverse-only
CPU 2.0 s/turn (100k/beam, 15 slices, 8 threads); transverse-only CUDA 0.62
s/turn at 2.56M/beam, ~4x faster than PIC on GPU. The default
`longitudinal_kick=true` path now applies the PIC-style synchro-beam drift and
potential-difference `pz` kick on CPU and CUDA; see the dated optimization
history for current 6D timing and solver-difference records.

The longitudinal synchro-beam kick and midpoint luminosity refinement are now
complete and validated against PIC. Remaining Open items are performance/accuracy
refinements.

### Open (priority order)

The overriding question is throughput: the whole rationale for the spectral solver
was being ~4x faster than PIC, but that lead was measured on the transverse-only
map. The full 6D map needs **four** source-boundary spectral solves per slice pair
(left/right x two directions), and at that cost the current 6D grid path is
*slower* than PIC (CPU 5.06 vs 4.23 s/turn; CUDA 1.33 vs 0.23 s/turn at 20k/beam,
`grid=(128,1024)`). Restoring a decisive speed advantage in 6D is the top priority;
accuracy refinements come after.

1. **CUDA 6D throughput (top priority).** The GPU 6D path is ~6x slower than PIC,
   so this is where the solver currently fails to justify itself. Profile the four
   per-pair field solves and their kernels. A per-pair 4-plane cuFFT batch was
   already measured and rejected (slower). Next: batch the field solves across an
   entire dependency-safe collision *wavefront* (all independent slice pairs at one
   collision time share the box and plans), turning many small transforms into a
   few large batched ones and amortizing kernel-launch latency. Gate acceptance on
   complete-turn A/B timing plus the CPU/CUDA 6D parity test.
2. **CPU 6D performance campaign.** Profile complete 6D turns at production
   settings (`grid=(128,1024)`, 15 slices) and attack the dominant costs (deposit,
   the four transforms/mode-multiplies per pair, interpolation/scatter, luminosity,
   worker sync, allocation) before changing defaults. Note the four solves reuse
   one box/plan set already; the win is in reducing redundant transforms (e.g.
   compute both directions' fields from shared drifted-source transforms where the
   math allows) and in wavefront-level workspace batching.
3. Adaptive spectral Dirichlet-box strategy: the current spectral kick solve uses
  one shared global square box for both source and field beams across all slice
  pairs. This is conservative and keeps DST/DCT plans and workspaces simple, but
  it can leave many empty cells/modes for individual slice-pair solves. Explore a
  slice-pair or wavefront adaptive box that remains much larger than the local
  source/field particle domain, e.g. `max(domain_factor * local_sigma_max,
  extrema_margin * local_extrema_max)` with a floor from the full-beam RMS. Unlike
  PIC, the spectral Dirichlet box must not tightly wrap particles because
  `phi=0` at the boundary changes the physics; accuracy must be checked against
  Gaussian/PIC comparisons and the high-energy weak-strong limit. Reuse the PIC
  `green_cache=:slice_pair` design as the implementation pattern: fixed
  `grid=(Nx,Ny)` keeps transform plans reusable, while mode-Green arrays
  `1/(alpha_l^2+beta_m^2)` are cached by slice-pair or quantized box size with
  min-ratio/growth-style rebuild controls.
4. Grid-free spectral performance campaign: keep the direct-mode solver as a
  serious optimized reference path, not just a correctness fallback. Profile and
  optimize the harmonic recurrence, dense mode products, allocation reuse, and
  slice-pair scheduling for representative mode counts such as `48x48`. Note that
  grid-free needs `~64x256` modes (not `48x48`) to resolve the ~11:1 flat beam's
  `pz` kick to ~1% of PIC, so the representative flat-beam reference is heavier
  than the round-beam case.
5. Optional precision refinement: TSC field interpolation (or a finer mesh) to
  close the round-beam gap between the interpolated on-mesh result (~2.7e-3) and
  the per-point analytic (~1.6e-3).

### Completed

- Grid longitudinal-potential factor-of-2 fix (CPU and CUDA): the on-mesh
  potential `Phig` needed an explicit `1/2` (2D DST reconstruction carries factor
  4, each field component factor 2, sharing one fitted `scale`). Before the fix the
  grid `pz` kick was ~2x too large. After: grid `pz` matches PIC to ~0.5%,
  grid-free to ~1%, and `E = -grad(phi)` finite-difference consistency holds.
  Guarded by a CPU round-beam `rms(dpz)`-vs-PIC test and by the CUDA parity test
  now covering `longitudinal_kick=true`. Removed the dead CPU
  `_spectral_midpoint_luminosity_pair` helpers (superseded by
  `_spectral_midpoint_source` + `_spectral_luminosity_pair`).
- Full 6D synchro-beam map (CPU and CUDA): `longitudinal_kick=true` drifts source
  slices to field-slice boundaries, interpolates left/right spectral fields,
  applies the potential-difference `pz` kick, and reverses the field-particle
  virtual drift. `longitudinal_kick=false` keeps the original transverse-only map.
- Midpoint density-overlap luminosity for the full 6D path: both slices are
  drifted to the common collision midpoint before the spectral/PIC-style density
  overlap. The transverse-only comparison path keeps its original order-
  independent x/y overlap.
- Solver-comparison harness:
  `validation/strong_strong_spectral_comparison.jl` records timing, luminosity,
  final beam moments, and particle-coordinate differences against PIC/Gaussian
  references under `result/strong_strong_spectral_*`.
- Grid-free performance pass: direct mode coefficients and field evaluation now
  use harmonic recurrence plus dense matrix products, cutting the measured
  48x48 direct-mode reference case while preserving the grid-free API.
- Density-overlap luminosity (CPU and CUDA): CIC-deposit both source slices on a
  shared grid, sum the product, scale `npart1*npart2/(nmacro1*nmacro2)` over the
  cell area. Matches `_pic_luminosity!` to machine precision on identical inputs and
  agrees with PIC/Gaussian to ~4% on the production beams.
- CPU caching + parallelism: reusable per-worker workspace pool (deposit/mode/
  derivative buffers + FFTW plans, mode-Green recomputed only when the box changes),
  cutting per-solve allocation ~18 MiB -> 105 KiB; collision parallelized over field
  slices. 100k/beam, 15 slices, grid 128x1024: 9.7 -> 2.0 s/turn (~4.1x on 8
  threads), bit-consistent across thread counts.
- CUDA `collide!` for the grid path (`spectral_cuda.jl`): DST-I/DCT-I built from
  complex cuFFT of symmetric extensions (verified to machine precision vs FFTW),
  one in-place plan per dimension, cached workspace, custom deposit/interp-scatter/
  luminosity kernels. Agrees with the CPU path to ~4e-16 (kicks) and ~9e-16
  (luminosity); 0.62 s/turn at 2.56M/beam, ~4x faster than PIC CUDA at matched grid.
- Validation tests in `test/runtests.jl`: spectral-vs-Gaussian accuracy (both
  variants, round beam, <3%) and CPU/CUDA consistency (rtol 1e-9).
- Production parameter selection: grid `(128, 1024)`, `domain_factor=16` for ~11:1
  beams (grid-converged kick to ~1%, at the graininess floor). See the dated
  `validation/strong_strong_spectral_optimization_history.md`.

### Completed (solver core)

- `SpectralPoissonSolver{T} <: AbstractPoissonSolver`
  (`src/tasks/strongstrong/spectral.jl`): auto-registered, structured option
  schema (`slicing`/`slicing1`/`slicing2`, physical `kbb1`/`kbb2`,
  `luminosity_scale`, `grid`, `domain_factor`, `method`), both `:grid` (CIC deposit
  -> 2D DST -> mode solve -> on-mesh DST/DCT derivative -> interpolate) and
  `:grid_free` (direct converged mode sums) field solves, and a transverse CPU
  `collide!` over slice pairs in collision order.
- Field-solve normalization pinned to physical units. The source deposit is
  normalized to unit charge inside the field solve, so the field is the
  per-unit-charge Bassetti-Erskine field and the caller applies physical
  `kbb * slice_weight` **identically to `GaussianPoissonSolver`** (no `/n_macro`;
  kbb means the same across Gaussian/PIC/spectral). Two separately pinned scale
  constants: grid folds in the DST inverse-normalization and grows with mode count;
  grid-free uses a mode-count-independent constant (the direct sum is converged).
  Verified: round-beam kick matches the soft-Gaussian solver to ~0.2% for both
  variants, and stays within ~0.3% across `domain_factor` 10-16 (drift at larger
  `d` is fixed-grid resolution loss, not normalization).
- Flat-beam box fix. `_spectral_box` was sizing the Dirichlet box anisotropically
  (`Ly ~ d*sigma_y`), which clips the wide field of a flat beam (its transverse
  field extends on the `sigma_large` scale in both directions) and biased the
  wide-direction kick by ~9% at 5:1 (plateauing, not a resolution effect). Fixed
  to a square box sized to `sigma_max` in both directions, matching the docs and
  the earlier validation, with the thin direction resolved by the grid (`Ny`).
  Verified against the soft-Gaussian solver: flat 5:1 now matches to ~0.5% at
  `(128,512)`, and the production ~11:1 flat beam matches to ~0.4% at `(128,1024)`
  (`N_thin ~ 5*d*sigma_x/sigma_y`); round-beam accuracy is unchanged.
- Derivation of the 2D Fourier sine-series Poisson solver, discrete DST/FFT form,
  open-boundary discussion, circular/elliptical generalization, and correctness
  checks (manufactured band-limited solution recovered to 1e-15).
- Accuracy validation against Bassetti-Erskine for round and flat beams, with
  domain-size and thin-direction scaling regressions and parameter-selection
  guidance (domain `d ~ 12-16*max(sigma)`; anisotropic grid).
- Grid and grid-free variants with a computational-complexity comparison
  (grid/DST is 100-1000x faster than grid-free).
- Exact spectral field derivative: 2-3x more accurate than finite differences;
  the solver beats PIC on flat beams (25:1 median ~30% lower, max ~3x better) and
  ties on round.
- Fast on-mesh spectral-derivative field pipeline (O(Nx*Ny*log)) validated to
  retain the accuracy advantage at ~4x lower cost than PIC. The DST-I mesh cosine
  derivative equals a zero-padded DCT-I (verified to machine precision).

## Earlier Completed

  wavefront launches): 0.2778 -> 0.2280 s/turn, bit-identical. See
  `validation/strong_strong_gaussian_optimization_history.md`.
- PIC `kbb1/kbb2` override switched to physical units, consistent across all
  solvers and frozen-beam elements.

  soft-Gaussian solver as a commented alternative.
- Lorentz crossing maps classified as Hirata quasi-symplectic (`NonSymplectic6DMap`).
